# **Import Products From the BigQuery Table Tutorial**

## Let's get started

Retail API offers you a convenient way to import your catalog data from previously loaded BigQuery table.

Using BigQuery table allows you to import massive amounts of catalog data with no limits.

Moreover, you can specify the Retail schema that has more product attributes than other import options including
key/value custom attributes.

You can choose one of the reconciliation modes, **INCREMENTAL** or **FULL**, using the BigQuery table as an import source.

 - Incremental import creates products that did not exist in a catalog before importing and updates all current products.
 - Full import deletes current products if they are not present in the BigQuery source, adds new products, and updates
  current products that existed in the catalog before importing and in the BigQuery table.

To find more information about different import types, their restrictions, and use cases, check the [Retail API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/upload-catalog#considerations)

## Before you begin

To run Python code samples from this tutorial, you need to set up your virtual environment.

To do that, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv tutorial-env
```

```bash
source tutorial-env/bin/activate
```

Next, install Google packages:

```bash
python3 -m pip install google
python3 -m pip install google.cloud.retail
python3 -m pip install google.cloud.storage
python3 -m pip install google.cloud.bigquery
```

**Tip**: Click the copy button on the side of the code box to paste the command in the Cloud Shell terminal and run it.

## Set the PROJECT_NUMBER environment variable

As you are going to run the code samples in your own Cloud Project, you should specify the **project_id** as an environment variable, it will be used in every request to the Retail API.

You can find the ```project_number``` in the **Home/Dashboard/Project Info card**.

Set the environment variable with a following command:
```bash
export PROJECT_NUMBER=<YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER>
```

## Create the BigQuery table and upload products

Before you import products to your catalog, you need to upload the data to the BigQuery table first. There are two ways to do it:

 - Create an [empty BigQuery table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables#creating_an_empty_table_with_a_schema_definition)
  using the Retail schema, and create products in it using SQL.
 - Create a BigQuery table using the prepared JSON file with products. You can define the [Retail schema](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/catalog#expandable-1) or
  use an autodetect option.
   
To upload the data to the BigQuery table you need to create a dataset first, then create table with specific Retail data schema. 
Next, upload data to the table from prepared JSON file. The data in the file should correspond the Retail schema as well.

There is a **product/products.json** with valid products. You should upload it to the **```products```** dataset, **```products```** table.

Also, there is a **product/products_some_invalid.json** containing some invalid products along with valid ones. You should uploadt it to the **```products```** dataset, **```products_some_invalid```** table. This table will be used to demonstrate the error handling.

Run the following code in the Terminal to create tables and import data:
```bash
python product/create_bigquery_table.py
```
The dataset "products" with both tables are created, check them in [Cloud Console](https://console.corp.google.com/bigquery)

## Create the BigQuery table and upload products from UI admin console

In case if you do not have permissions to run the ```bq``` command and performing the previous step you have got "Permission denied" error, you can try the other way to create the table and upload your data.

### Upload catalog data to Cloud Storage

There is a JSON file with valid products prepared in the "product" directory: 

**product/products.json**.

The other file, **product/products_some_invalid.json**, contains both valid and invalid products, you will use in to check the error handling.
 
In your own project you should create a Cloud Storage bucket and put the JSON file there.
The bucket name must be unique, for convenience it can be named as <YOUR_PROJUCT_ID>_<TIMESTAMP>.

To create the bucket and upload the JSON file run the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
python product/create_gcs_bucket.py
```
Now you can see the bucket is created in the [Cloud Storage](pantheon.corp.google.com/storage/browser), and the file is uploaded.

The **name of the created GRS bucket** is printed in the Terminal, save it somewhere, you will need it om the next step

### Create the BigQuery table and upload products

Go to the [BigQuery in Cloud Console](https://console.corp.google.com/bigquery).

1. In the Explorer panel you see the list of your projects. 
2. Click the "three dot" icon next to current project name and chose **Create Dataset** option.
   Set the Dataset Id and click **Create**.
3. Click "three dots" icon next to your new dataset and chose **Create Table**.
   3.1 Set the **Source**: in the field **Create table from** chose **Google Cloud Storage** option.
   Click **Browse** in the **Select file from GCS bucket** and chose the bucket you have created on the previous step. Chose the **products.json**, click Select.
   3.2 Set the **Destination** field **Table** with a value **```products```**
   3.3 Next, provide a table **Schema**. Click **Edit as a text** and paste in the field the schema which you can find in the **produc–µ/product_schema.json** file.
   Then, click **Create table**.
   
As a result the BigQuery table is created. You can proceed and import products to the catalog.

## Import products from the BigQuery table

Open **product/import_products_big_query_table.py** and look at the example of the import product request.

The field **```parent```** contains a **catalog name** along with a branch number you are going to import your
products to.

The field **```input_config```** defines the **BigQuerySource** as an import source.

To import products, open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python product/import_products_big_query_table.py
```

## Response analysis

Once you have called the import products method, the **import operation** has started.

Importing may take some time depending on the size of your BigQuery table.

The operation is completed when the field **```operation.done()```** is set to true. 

Check the result, one of the following fields should be present:
 - **```error```**, if the operation failed.
 - **```result```**, if the operation was successful.

You have imported valid product objects into the catalog.

Check the ```big_query_operation.metadata.success_count``` field to get the total number of the successfully imported products. Their expected number is 316.

The number of failures during the product import is returned in ```big_query_operation.metadata.failure_count``` field. Their expected number is 0.

The operation is successful, and the operation object contains a **```result```** field.
Check it printed out in a Terminal. It should look like the next example: 
```
errors_config {
  gcs_prefix: "gs://945579214386_us_import_product/errors7399332380794639317"
}
```

## Errors appeared during product importing

Now, let's try to import a couple of invalid product objects and check the error message in the operation response. 

The title field is required, so if you remove it, you get the invalid product object. 
Another example of an invalid product is a product with an incorrect value of the ```product.availability``` field.
There is a **```products_for_import_invalid```** table in the BigQuery dataset that contains such invalid products.

Let's use it for importing to get an error message.

Go to the code sample and assign the ```table_id```value to the table with invalid products:

```py
table_id = "products_for_import_invalid"
```
Now, run the code sample and wait till the operation is completed. 

Next, check the operation printed out to the Terminal.

## Errors appeared during the importing. Output analysis

If the operation is completed successfully, you can find a **```result```** field. Otherwise, there would be an **```error```** field instead.

In this case, the operation is considered as successful, and the ```big_query_operation.metadata.success_count``` field contains the number of the successfully imported products, which is "2".

There are two invalid products in the BigQuery table, and the number of failures during the product import in the ```big_query_operation.metadata.failure_count``` field is "1".

The ```operation.result``` field points to the errors bucket where you can find a json file with all the importing errors.

The error is the following: 

```json
{"code":3,"message":"Invalid value at 'availability' (type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.retail.v2main.Product.Availability): \"INVALID_VALUE\"","details":[{"@type":"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Struct","value":{"line_number":1}}]}
```

## Errors appeared due to invalid request

Next, let's send invalid import request to make the operation fail. 

In the code sample, find the **```get_import_products_big_query_request()```** method, and add there a local variable ```default_catalog``` with some invalid catalog name.

Now, run the code again and check the error message, it should look like this:

```
google.api_core.exceptions.InvalidArgument: 400 Request contains an invalid argument.
```
