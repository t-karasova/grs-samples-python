# **Pagination Tutorial**

## Let's get started

Using pagination is simple and easy way not only to view and navigate through the search results, but also to decrease the lookup time and the size of the responses.

This tutorial will show you how to send request using parameters of pagination.

There are three fields in the search request which give you all the posibilities of navigation through the search results: 
- **```page_size```**, 
- **```next_page_token```**,
- **```offset```**.

Lets see how each of them works.

**Time to complete**: About 2 minutes

## Before you begin

To run Python code samples from this tutorial you will need to setup your virtual environment.

Please use these commands in a terminal:
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
```bash
virtualenv <your-env>
```
```bash
source <your-env>/bin/activate
```

Now install google packages:
```bash
pip install google
```
```bash
pip install google-cloud-retail
```

**Tip**: Click the copy button on the side of the code box to paste the command in the Cloud Shell terminal to run it.


## Page size

The ```page_size``` request field allows you to limit the number of items in the search response.

Open **search_with_pagination_page_size.py** to view the request with ```page_size```.

Run it in a terminal with a command:
```bash
python search_with_pagination_page_size.py
```

## Page size. Response analyze

Now you can see the **```results[]```** contains the number of products which you set as page size.

The **```total_size```** does not equal the page size, it's the number of matched items for this search query, so it will not change as you are changing the number of products per page.

The **```next_page_token```** will be used in the next tutorial step.

## Next page token

As you have received the response from previous step you can take the value from field ```next_page_token```.
If you send the **same** request, but as a request parameter you will set **```page_token```** with ```next_page_token``` value, you will get the result products with the next **<page_size>** relevance.

Open the **search_with_pagination_next_page.py**, 

As you will run it whole independently, we placed there a sequence of requests:
- First is with only the page size. You will get the next_page_token value from it's response, 
- Another one demonstrates the navigation to the next page using ```page_token``` and this value. 

Run it in a terminal with a command:
```bash
python search_with_pagination_next_page.py
```

## Next page token. Response analyze

In the response you can see the next page of products which is the next <page_size> relevance.

The field **```next_page_token```** now has value generated to point on the next page and can be used in further results navigation.

## Offset

In some other cases, instead of navigating from page to page or getting results with top relevance, you can directly jump to a particular position with offset.

For example, if you want the tenth page of the results when the page size is 5, you can set the offset to be **45**, which is calculated by **(10 - 1) * 5**.

Open the **search_with_pagination_offset.py**, run it and check the result of **```page_size```** and the **```offset```** parameters combination.

Run it in a terminal with a command:
```bash
python search_with_pagination_offset.py
```

## Offset. Response analyze

In the response you can see the requested page of products. 

The field **```next_page_token```** now has value generated to point on the next page and can be used in further results navigation.


## Success 

You have complete the tutorial and now we **encourage** you to **test the pagination by yourself**, right here in the CloudShell environment, using different combinations of values for pafination parameters
