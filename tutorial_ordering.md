# **Ordering Tutorial**

## Let's get started

This tutorial will show you how to order items in a search response. 

The ordering can be applied to the most of the product fields, the full list of the fields you can find in [Retail API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/filter-and-order#order)


Lets see how the ordering works.

**Time to complete**: About 2 minutes

## Before you begin

To run Python code samples from this tutorial you will need to setup your virtual environment.

Please use this commands in a terminal:
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
```bash
virtualenv <your-env>
```
```bash
source <your-env>/bin/activate
```
Now install google packages:
```bash
pip install google
```
```bash
pip install google-cloud-retail
```

**Tip**: Click the copy button on the side of the code box to paste the command in the Cloud Shell terminal to run it.


## Ordering by single field

To use the ordering feature you need to specify the field and the ordering direction. You can order by textual as well as by numerical fields.

First let's order the search results by price, the more expensive should appear on the top, in such case the ordering expression should be set as 

```order = 'price desc'```
 

To see the whole request with an ordering open **search_with_ordering.py**

Run it in a terminal with a command:
```bash
python search_with_ordering.py
```

Now you can see the ```results[]``` are ordered descending.

Next let's change the ordering direction to show the cheapest products first

Just find the comment 

"# [TRY DIFFERENT ORDERING EXPRESSIONS HERE:]" 

and change the ordering expresion to: 
```order = 'price asc'``` or just ```order = 'price'``` - that's an equal expressions

Run the sample in a terminal with a command:
```bash
python search_with_ordering.py
```

Now you see the products are ordered by price ascending

## Ordering by multiple fields

Ordering by multiple fields is supported through the use of comma-separated fields in order of priority. 

The lower priority fields will be used to order items with equal values for higher priority fields. 


For example, **```rating desc, price```** would order items by their rating first, then the products with the same rating will be ordered by price.

To try that, please change the ordering expression to:
```
order = 'rating desc, price'
```

Run the code sample in a terminal using command:
```bash
python search_with_ordering.py
```

## Success 

You have complete the tutorial and now we **encourage** you to **test the ordering by yourself**, try different combinations of different order expressions.

**Thank you for compleating this tutorial!**
